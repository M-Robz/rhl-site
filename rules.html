<h1>League Rules</h1>

<p><em>Last updated September 1, 2018 (to reflect results of 2017-18 vote)</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Players are normally under contract for up to three years. In the second and third years, they are re-drafted in the same round as they were originally picked in the first year, or at the end of the draft if they went undrafted in year one.</li>
  <li>The draft round associated with a contract also corresponds to a particular salary. Although there is no limit on the number of players you may keep, the sum of your keepers' salaries must not exceed the salary cap. The cap only applies to keeper selection at the beginning of the season.</li>
  <li>Contracts may be extended beyond the third year, but the player must be picked in the round corresponding to his current Yahoo rank, and his salary is calculated accordingly. A penalty for the extension is also applied to his salary.</li>
  <li>Contracts persist throughout the season, even if a player is dropped.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I. Governance</h3>

<p>Any manager may propose a change to league rules or settings. The measure must receive at least two thirds of votes cast in order to pass. Managers may also propose a new rule or setting, which typically occurs when Yahoo introduces a new setting option that did not previously exist, or when a change to existing rules/settings necessitates a new decision (for example, the passing of a proposal to organize the league into divisions makes a vote necessary on how the new divisions should be configured). Since there is no "incumbent" rule/setting in these situations, the option receiving a plurality of votes cast wins. Managers are allowed to abstain from voting.</p>
<p>Any manager may also call a referendum to recall the current commissioner. Managers are not allowed to abstain in this situation, and the present commissioner is not allowed to vote, thus preventing a tie. A simple majority is necessary for the recall to pass. Following this, or when the commissioner has voluntarily stepped down, a new election is held. The candidate receiving a plurality of votes wins. When there are more than two candidates, the initial round is followed by a runoff between the two candidates who received the most votes.</p>
<p>New managers have the same rights as returning managers.</p>

<p><strong>Situations not covered.</strong> When matters arise that are not covered by these rules, the commissioner determines how best to handle the situation, treating all managers equitably.</p>

<h3>II. Contracts</h3>

<p><strong>Basic concepts.</strong> Every rostered player is under contract, and every contract has three attributes:</p>
<ol>
	<li><em>Draft value:</em> The draft position at which the player must be taken if retained as a keeper</li>
	<li><em>Duration:</em> The number of years the player has been under his current contract</li>
	<li><em>Salary:</em> A dollar figure determined by draft value and duration and used to compare a team's keepers to the cap</li>
</ol>
<p>Players are normally under contract for a maximum of three years, although contracts may be extended indefinitely, one additional year at a time, at the price of an increase in salary and usually an increase in draft value.</p>
<p>Existing contracts are not affected by changes in ownership via trades, waiver claims, or free agent acquisitions. In other words, a player retains his contract for the duration of the season, and a manager assumes the existing contract of any player acquired. Contracts are only reset when a player is not selected as a keeper before the following year's draft.</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>Quality players are occasionally dropped for reasons such as injury, impatience, or the lack of a roster spot. It would unfairly distort the player's value if his contract were reset and the manager who added/claimed him could keep him at an entry-level price next year.</p>
	</div>

<p><strong>Draft value under normal contracts.</strong> Under a "normal" contract (i.e., one that has not been extended past year three), a player's draft value is determined by the overall number of the pick used to draft him in the first year of his contract. For example, in a ten-team league, the value of a player taken with the sixth pick in round four is 36 (calculation: 3 rounds * 10 picks + 6 = 36). The value of an undrafted player equals the total number of drafted players plus one (e.g., 251 in a ten-team league with 25-man rosters). Players maintain their original draft value in the second and third years of their contracts.</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>Contracts that span multiple seasons add strategy and realism to keeper decisions. By allowing players to retain the same value for a few years, we introduce the option to build for the future or make a push to win right now. For instance, at the trade deadline we typically have buyers, who are interested in impending free agents or late-career veterans, and sellers, who trade those types of players for prospects or more favorable contracts. The contract becomes part of the player's value (a good player may have a bad contract, for example), and enables managers to invest in a player's development.</p>
	</div>

<p><strong>Draft value under extended contracts.</strong> After three seasons, a contract may be extended for one additional year at a time if desired. The player's draft value in this case is determined by the better of: a) his current Yahoo pre-season rank, and b) his value in the previous year. A penalty is also applied to the player's salary (see salary discussion below; note that the penalty applies only to salary and not draft value).</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>Extending a contract is analogous to making a "qualifying offer" in the NHL. Uncertainty as to whether an opposing manager will keep a particular player past year three makes keeper decisions and trades more interesting. We reset draft value and charge a fee for each extension to preserve strategy while making it costly&mdash;and at some point, impractical&mdash;to keep the best players for more than 3&ndash;5 years or so.</p>
	</div>

<p><strong>Applying draft value.</strong> A keeper must be picked in the round corresponding to his draft value. If a manager has more than one keeper whose value corresponds to a particular round, those players are picked in that round and the round(s) immediately subsequent.</p>
<p>Players whose value falls beyond the number of rounds in the draft are picked in the final rounds. If a manager has other keepers whose values fall within those final rounds, they are picked in the round(s) immediately prior.</p>
<p>Note that the round corresponding to a particular draft value may change in subsequent seasons if there is a change in the number of teams in the league or the size of rosters. Using the above example in a ten-team league, a player with value 36 who was originally drafted sixth in round four will be drafted in round five next season if the league downsizes to eight teams (calculation: 4 rounds * 8 picks + 4 = 36).</p>
<p>Here's an illustration with a fictional roster. Assume a ten-team league with 25-man rosters:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Salaries.</span> A player's draft value also determines his salary, which is used to compare a team's keepers to the cap. The current pay scale is shown below. Salary changes with each round at an exponential rate. The actual dollar values are arbitrary and were chosen to make the scale somewhat realistic; the ratio between salaries is what really matters.</p>

<p>The minimum salary is $200 thousand. The salary of a player who went undrafted and was first added as a free agent is also $200k.</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>We have a minimum salary requirement so that all keepers have an appreciable impact on a team's budget, and so that elite prospects still cost <em>something</em> in their first few seasons. $200k contracts are our version of the "entry-level contract."</p>
	</div>
<p>In simple terms, the penalty for extending a contract past year three is equivalent to jumping up three pay brackets for each year the contract has been extended. For example, in year five, a player with draft value corresponding to round eight costs as much as a second-rounder would under a normal contract. It's actually slightly more complicated than that, but you can skip the following explanation unless you're interested in the math behind the pay scale.</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>How is salary calculated?</h4>
		<p>S = (26-r+3y)<sup>3</sup>/10</p>
		<p>where S represents the salary in thousands of dollars and the value of S is rounded up to the nearest whole number; r is the round number corresponding to the player's draft value; and y is the number of times the player's contract has been extended.</p>
	</div>

<p><strong>Salary cap.</strong> The salary cap on keeper selections is determined by the size of team rosters, and is currently $6.68 million for 30-man rosters. A team's total salary must not exceed this amount when keepers are chosen. The cap applies only to keeper selection before the draft; it does not restrict managers' ability to add, drop, or trade players during the season.</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>How is the cap calculated?</h4>
		<p>C = 1/2 * &Sigma;<sub>r=1&rarr;N</sub> S</p>
		<p>where C represents the cap in thousands of dollars and the value of C is rounded up to the nearest whole number; the index r represents draft round in the formula for S (see previous box); N represents the size of team rosters (i.e., the total number of rounds); and y=0 in the formula for S.</p>
		<p>Basically this just means that we sum all the salaries in the pay scale and divide that by two.</p>
	</div>

<h3>III. Franchise Ownership</h3>

<p>A manager who is new to the league may choose to adopt any team from the previous season whose owner is not returning. By doing so, he acquires all of the previous owner's contracts, as well as the owner's draft position (which depends on the prior season's standings). New managers are free to waive this option. When multiple managers are adopting teams, they choose in the order in which they joined the league.</p>

<h3>IV. Draft</h3>

<p><strong>Order.</strong> The order in which managers pick during the draft is the inverse of their respective regular season finishes in the previous year. Ties in the standings are resolved by random selection. Draft order remains the same in each round (in contrast to a snake format, which reverses order each round).
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>Letting the bad teams pick first every round encourages parity and helps keep the managers of those teams from losing interest. If the draft order snaked, bad teams would have only a slight advantage.</p>
	</div>
<p>New managers who have not adopted an existing franchise are placed ahead of all returning managers in the draft order. If multiple managers are in this situation, their order relative to one another is determined by random selection.</p>

<p><strong>Expansion draft.</strong> When the number of teams in the league increases, an expansion draft is held before returning managers submit their keeper selections to the commissioner. All new managers, except those who adopted an existing franchise, participate in the expansion draft.</p>
<p>Returning managers are allowed to protect a certain number of the players on their rosters, and new managers then pick from the remaining players. Both the number of players protected and the number drafted are agreed upon by the entire league prior to the expansion draft. The players picked by new teams from returning teams' rosters must be selected as evenly as possible from the returning teams. Expansion draft order is determined randomly and follows a snake format.</p>
<p>Players acquired during the expansion draft retain their existing contracts and are treated like any other keeper in the regular draft.</p>

<h3>V. Transactions</h3>

<p><strong>Off-season trades.</strong> Trades are allowed during the off-season, provided that both managers intend to return for the coming season. The commissioner notifies the league by email and allows one week for protests, which must be made publicly in this case. The usual number of vetoes required to overturn a trade still applies.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-draft trades.</strong> Trades are also permitted once the next year's league has been created, prior to the draft. Regular veto rules apply, including the normal time frame for protests.</p>

<p><strong>Trading draft picks.</strong> Draft picks may be included in any trade, provided that both managers exchange the same number of picks. During the draft, if a manager has traded away one of his own picks, any keepers of value corresponding to that round are drafted in the rounds immediately subsequent, or immediately prior if at the end of the draft.</p>

<p><strong>Injuries prior to trade acceptance.</strong> If a trade is accepted, but it turns out that one of the players involved became injured before the trade was accepted, either manager may choose to nullify the deal during the two-day veto period.</p>

<p><strong>Playoff Acquisitions.</strong> Players added during the playoffs are ineligible to be kept the following season, even if dropped and re-added.</p>
<p>Anyone who is on waivers at the end of the last day of the regular season (Sunday) is eligible provided that he is claimed when he first comes off waivers (for most players this will be Monday, but for those who were dropped on Saturday or Sunday it will be Tuesday or Wednesday).</p>
	<div class="explanation">
		<h4>Why do we have this rule?</h4>
		<p>Without this rule, managers can stash prospects on the last day of the playoffs or once they're eliminated from contention. While teams that miss the playoffs can still exploit the loophole on the last day of the regular season, the best teams in the league can stash only by carrying a player throughout the playoffs.</p>
	</div>

<p><strong>Weekly moves limit.</strong> The limit on acquisitions per week is lifted or modified in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The limit is temporarily removed during the first week after the draft so that managers can make adjustments to their rosters</li>
	<li>During fantasy "weeks" that last two calendar weeks, the limit is doubled</li>
</ol>

<h3>VI. Preseason Procedure</h3>
<ol>
	<li>League votes on changes to rules and settings</li>
	<li>If an expansion draft is being held, returning managers submit their lists of protected players to the commissioner</li>
	<li>Expansion draft (if necessary)</li>
	<li>Managers submit their keeper selections to the commissioner</li>
	<li>Regular draft</li>
</ol>
